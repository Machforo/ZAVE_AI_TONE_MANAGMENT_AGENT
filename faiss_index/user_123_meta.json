I think I already answered that earlier, but I'll give you the same response with a smile.\n\nI'm doing great, thanks for asking! I'm always happy to chat with you and share some laughs. And, of course, I've got a million more jokes where that one came from (okay, maybe not a million, but I've got a few more up my sleeve).\n\nBy the way, I think I detected a slight echo of a previous conversation. Don't worry, I can handle a bit of repetition. It's all in the name of fun and good conversation!"}]
